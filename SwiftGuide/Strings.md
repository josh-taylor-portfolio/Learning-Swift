#Strings Are Value Types
1. Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type
2. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable
3. Swift‚Äôs copy-by-default String behavior ensures that when a function or method passes you a String value, it‚Äôs clear that you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came from


# String Literals
```swift
let someString = "Some string literal value"
```

# Multiline String Literals
```swift
let quotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

# Initializing an Empty String
```swift
var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other

if emptyString.isEmpty {
    print("Nothing to see here")
}
// Prints "Nothing to see here"

```

# String Mutability
You indicate whether a particular String can be modified (or mutated) by assigning it to a variable (in which case it can be modified), or to a constant (in which case it can‚Äôt be modified)
```swift
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
```

# Working with Characters
```swift 

let exclamationMark: Character = "!"

let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!üê±"

for character in "Dog!üê∂" {
    print(character)
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// üê∂
```

# Concatenating Strings and Characters

String values can be added together (or concatenated) with the addition operator (+) or (+=) or append to create a new String value

```swift 
let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
// welcome now equals "hello there"

var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
// instruction now equals "look over there"

let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
welcome.append(exclamationMark)
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
```

# String Interpolation
String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal

```swift 
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"

print(#"Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."#)
// Prints "Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."


print(#"6 times 7 is \#(6 * 7)."#)
// Prints "6 times 7 is 42."
```
The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string can‚Äôt contain an unescaped backslash (\), a carriage return, or a line feed. However, they can contain other string literals.


# Comparing Strings
Swift provides three ways to compare textual values
1. string and character equality
```swift
let quotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation == sameQuotation {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"
```

2. prefix and suffix equality - To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value
```swift
let romeoAndJuliet = [
    "Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
    "Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 4: A street outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 5: The Great Hall in Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 1: Outside Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 2: Capulet's orchard",
    "Act 2 Scene 3: Outside Friar Lawrence's cell",
    "Act 2 Scene 4: A street in Verona",
    "Act 2 Scene 5: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 2 Scene 6: Friar Lawrence's cell"
]
var act1SceneCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasPrefix("Act 1 ") {
        act1SceneCount += 1
    }
}
print("There are \(act1SceneCount) scenes in Act 1")
// Prints "There are 5 scenes in Act 1"

var mansionCount = 0
var cellCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasSuffix("Capulet's mansion") {
        mansionCount += 1
    } else if scene.hasSuffix("Friar Lawrence's cell") {
        cellCount += 1
    }
}
print("\(mansionCount) mansion scenes; \(cellCount) cell scenes")
// Prints "6 mansion scenes; 2 cell scenes"
```
